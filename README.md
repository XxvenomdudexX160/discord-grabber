Installation
1. Download Python:
Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed and it is added to your path.
2. Download The Files:
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
3. Open The setup.bat File:
You dont need to manually install any modules. Just opening setup.bat will install them for you. If successfull the setup.bat will then open up the gui.
4. Create A Webhook:
If you don't know how to make a webhook you can follow this guide: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
Once created, paste the webhook into the webhook prompt.
5. Configurable Options:
Now once you've done that you can tick the options that you want enabled and anything you don't understand you can go 
to the documentation where each option is explained.
6. Build The File
To finally create the file you must enter a filename and press build. Once fully built the build button will say 'Built File'.
7. What Now?
The file you built will now appear in the current folder with the name you set.
